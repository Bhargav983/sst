              </h2>
              <p>
                Our founders, with roots deeply embedded in the culinary traditions of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, 
                grew up savoring the distinct spice blends and masala pastes that define South Indian cooking. 
                They realized that the secret to these unforgettable flavors lay not just in the recipes, but in the quality of ingredients 
                and the meticulous preparation methods passed down through generations.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                SutraCart was established with a simple mission: to make these authentic, handcrafted masala pastes accessible to everyone, 
                without compromising on quality or tradition. We wanted to eliminate the hassle of sourcing numerous individual spices and 
                the time-consuming process of grinding them, allowing food lovers to create genuine South Indian dishes with ease.
